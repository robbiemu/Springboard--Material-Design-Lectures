# Material Design
## lecture notes for [Material design principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isYZXwaP3Q4)

_note: these are going to be light notes as this is the second coverage on the basic prinicples._

goal: craft a visual language that unifies concept of visual design with physical properties (which agree to our well-refined natural instincts).

so

**Material is the language**

### more on goals

motion ( as per newer hardware-based software UI/UX design)

tangability, physicality (As per industrial design)

So the idea to ensure the information comes across well is the story.

UI Stories are guided by metaphor that depend on our shared experience and transfer information. That is "material".

### design principles

#### Paper

a form of paper sufficiently advanced a sto be confused with magic. These supply _Surface_.

#### Dimentionality as heirarchy (?)

motion should not conflict with our visual, instinctual expectations

#### Content is bold, graphic, and intentional

using traditional print deisng measures like keylines.

`Palette` is an important control for color in material design.

1 standard icon set, designed on strong geometric shapes.

#### Motion carries information

for example, ripple effect tells you where you pressed, because you can infer it from the radiating graphic.

animation happens on a shared stage.

animated transitions apparently are meant to be the norm, between _all_ activities/states for the app. specifically, he called out "instanteneous transitions" as you go to new spaces in the app as something no longer being done in material design.

#### Interaction, design, engineering unification

the framework's reliance on phyics and solid specifications allows unification of formerly distinct teams.
