# Material Design
## lecture notes for [Material design in Google Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlY714W4uww)

* a look at how Google is incorporating Material Design paradigm in the google play store.
    He reffers often and early to incorporating mostly guidelines.
    Also talked about using templates to reuse conformant code

### breaking down how to apply material design to non-conformant projects.
    1. identify viewports you want to design to
    2. identify views you want to redesign
    3. get feedback and change interatively in sprints ( samll changes, day or week long.. he kind of emphasizes that dailies are not really always pratical)

### design process
    1. brainstorm: ux variations to compare and contrast
    2. narrow based on ability to conform to material design and to cwork together
    3. standardize on: *Typography*, *Color*, and *Imagery*, working to let the content speak for itself in the layout
    4. *Motion* was obviously separately considered. 
    
#### Motion
Look at motion based on story:
        * what brings the use to an action that starts the animation?
        * what happens during the transition?
        * what happens as the transition ends?

The transitions need to be simple enough that they do not distract.

### Implementation in Engineering
Essentially the same as other engineering tasks now, as there is a framework.

Design Advocacy is important even in engineering! They need to feel ownership for visual outcomes.

#### Highlights

* Cards, Elevation, and Shadows are all baked into material design
* RecyclerView, Scene Transitions

#### Structure

Very strong guidelines, very opinionated, and yet very wide, so conformable. 

The variables are meaningful to the designers and practicable to the engineers: they need to work in parellel to build iterations.

#### Story

Working with designers to find minutia and coroborate on variations available. Since motion is more programming-instensive, it is more open to engineers to immediately pitch in  in the visuals.
